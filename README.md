# Jasmine Ng's Programming Projects

This repository contains code used for Jasmine's dissertation, summer internship, and classwork. 
Below is a brief description of each project and the corresponding files:

## Using CoDa-PCA and linear models to understand Barium compositions 

**Results available in webpage format** [here](https://jasmineng-codes.github.io/barium_compositional_pca/).
**Full R Code available** [here](https://github.com/JasmineNg-codes/My-projects/blob/main/HIF_germany_internship_Rcode.Rmd).

**Objective**: To explore how trace elements in vegetation may serve as indicators for mineral ores. 

**Research question**: As a summer intern at HIF, I tidied the sample data from the Canadian Geological Survey database and addressed three main questions-
  1) From a compositional PCA biplot of vegetation trace elements, what elements are behaving differently from the rest?
  2) Is this a result of local geology and potential mineral ores?
  3) If not, what are the other potential drivers for the distinct elemental signal?
    
**Method**: Compositional data analysis (center log-ratio transformation), Principal component analysis, forward step-wise regression model
**Language**: R-studio

## Analyzing driver for bottom water hypoxia in Loch Etive

**Full Python Code available** [here](https://github.com/JasmineNg-codes/My-projects/blob/main/Year_3_Environmental_Geoscience_LochEtive_Project.ipynb).

**Research question**: In my third year, my individual project in Practical geochemistry and data analysis addressed -
  1) Are Mn/Al and FeHR/FeT reliable indicators for sediment redox?
  2) Is N/C (a proxy for terrestrial or marine sediment) correlated to bottom water hypoxia?

**Method**: Linear regression, box plots, t-test
**Language**: Python

## Modelling past climate with oxygen isotopes

**Full Python Code available** [here](https://github.com/JasmineNg-codes/My-projects/blob/main/Year_3_climate_modelling.ipynb)

**Research question**: In my third year, my coding assignment addressed how oxygen isotopes infer temperature changes from the Paleocene to the Pliocene.

**Method**: Linear regression
**Language**: Python

## Using CoDa-PCA to analyze the spatiotemporal change in trace metal pollutant in Glasgow top soils

**Full R Code available** [here](https://github.com/JasmineNg-codes/My-projects/blob/main/Year_4_Dissertation.R)

**Research question**: I am currently working on my 4th-year dissertation, which addresses:
  1) From a compositional PCA biplot of soil trace elements, what elements are clustering in urban areas?
  2) How does agricultural, industrial, recreational, and residential land use impact element compositions?
  3) What is the temporal change of selected urban elements between 2001, to 2018?
  4) What are the drivers for the spatial distribution of selected urban elements?

**Method**: Compositional data analysis (center log-ratio transformation), Principal component analysis, bar charts, ANOVA
**Language**: R
